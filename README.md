#  Optimizing Revenue Leakage & Profitability in the Hospitality Sector

This project focuses on identifying and minimizing revenue leakage in the hospitality industry using structured data analysis, SQL queries, and a Power BI dashboard. The analysis covers booking performance, cancellations, occupancy trends, and KPIs like RevPAR and ADR across multiple hotel properties.

##  Project Objectives

- Analyze key performance indicators like Occupancy Rate, RevPAR, ADR, and Cancellation %.
- Identify high-leakage points such as no-shows and booking platform inefficiencies.
- Build interactive visualizations in Power BI to support decision-making.
- Recommend strategies to improve profitability and operational efficiency.

##  Key KPIs Calculated

- **Occupancy Rate**  
- **Average Daily Rate (ADR)**  
- **Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR)**  
- **Cancellation % and No-Show %**  
- **Realization % (Checked Out vs No Show)**  
- **Room Class & Platform Contribution Analysis**

---

##  Recommendations

- Introduce dynamic pricing during low-occupancy periods.
- Improve follow-ups for no-show users to reduce leakage.
- Prioritize booking platforms with higher realization rates.
- Adjust inventory based on room class profitability.
